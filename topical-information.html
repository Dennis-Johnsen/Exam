                <b>Reflection task 1</b>
                <br>
                <i>Think about to which extent and how you, as a citizen or as a student or a professional, participate in one or more
                    "smart city"-initiatives, as Marikken describes them in her video.</i>
                <br>
                <br>
                One example of “digital cities” that Hanne Cecilie Geirbo brought up in module 2.1, was that people can ask questions
                to chat-bots and civil servants on the internet. In the start of the corona virus break out, a lot of people had questions
                about how many people that could be in the same house and such, since it was different rules in different locations. We citizens
                could ask a chat-bot our corona questions since it was so much misinformation. On the same website we could also sign up
                for a corona test and the corona vaccine. This was a great feature and got rid of people’s problems and did it digitally, so people
                didn’t have to show up physically and risk spreading the virus.
                A different example of a “digital city” feature is the bus app “Ruter billett”. If you need to travel with the bus, you can
                order your bus ticket in the app. Again, after the corona virus break out, the developers of the app also updated the app so
                you could check if the bus was crowded before you went on. Obviously to prevent more infection. This is just a few examples and
                the digital city features affect my life quite much since I travel with bus and train almost every day.

                <b>Reflection task 4</b>
                <br>
                <i>In the video, Jessica Giannoumis says that your future job may not yet exist. If you speculate freely, in what area can you
                    imagine that a not yet existing job opportunity might appear?</i>
                <br>
                <br>
                It is hard to guess what jobs may exist in the future. It can really be anything, but I think there will be more jobs connected to
                fighting climate change. We know that almost everything involves technology today, and all kinds of technology is developed better
                and better. It has a rapid increase in both effectiveness and area of use. We also know that climate change is an often-discussed
                subject. More people over the whole world engages in the fight about climate change. It is a very important task for the future to
                develop good ideas and ways to stop the earth from getting warmer and stop the trash dumping in the ocean. I think that it will
                be more IT jobs in the future that for example can be about developing better programs to control climate friendly machines in factories,
                electrical cars, mechanical devices that produce renewable resources such as, wind turbines, solar panels and more. Information
                technology covers a wide are of use and I think that it will be many new jobs in the future. It can be used to develop all kinds
                of things and I am looking forward to see what the future will look like.
